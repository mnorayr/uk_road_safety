# UK road accidents and safety dataÂ¶

Data contains information about the circumstances of personal injury road accidents in Great Britain in 2014. The statistics relate only to personal injury accidents on public roads that are reported to the police, and subsequently recorded, using the STATS19 accident reporting form. Information on damage-only accidents, with no human casualties or accidents on private roads or car parks are not included in this data.

Please note that we are only using one of the availble datasets, the accidents for 2014. Including more data from other years and the data with the vehicles and casualties will deliver more insight and better performing ML models.
